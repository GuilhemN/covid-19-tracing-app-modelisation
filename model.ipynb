    "# Modelling of the impact of social tracing apps: a contact network model\n",
    "\n",
    "by Alexandre Variengien, Simon Dupouy, Guilhem Niot, Timothé Picavet and Pierre Marrec.\n",
    "\n",
    "contact : [alexandre.variengien@ens-lyon.fr]\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to thank the _Soyez Prevenus_ team for proposing and organising this modelling challenge !\n",
    "\n",
    "**An online interactive version of this document is available [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master?filepath=model.ipynb)**\n",
    "### Context of creation\n",
    "\n",
    "This model was created during the \"Hack COVID19\" Hackathon, which took place between the 10th and the 12th of April and was organized by HEC and l'École Polytechnique.\n",
    "It was created to model the impact of the adoption of a social tracing app, like STOP COVID in France, on the spread of the pandemic.\n",
    "Its primary goal is to show the influence of parameters such as the proportion of users using the app in the global population or the effect of individual behaviour after receiving an exposure notification from the app on the epidemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are students in computer science at the ENS de Lyon, so we are not experts in the field of epidemiology. This model doesn't aim to provide precise predictions for the future of the pandemic.\n",
    "However, it is easily understandable and still reasonnably effective to get an overall sense of what we could expect from a social tracing app.\n",
    "More specifically, we believe it gives a good intuition about the impact a social tracing app may have on the epidemic depending on the adoption rate of the app.\n",
    "You may try changing the parameters to convince yourself that targeted quarantining of suspected cases can lead to a great limitation of the spread - if it is well adopted by the population.\n",
    "So feel free to play with our model!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bibliography\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model we used the contact network epidemiology approach, as it has been widely studied and it can account for the discrepency of transmission between individuals.\n",
    "It has been discussed that this approach is suited to model an epidemic as SARS-CoV-1 in [1].\n",
    "Moreover, the structure of the chosen graph has a great impact on the final extent of the outbreak, as discussed in [2].\n",
    "We chose two models for the graph:\n",
    "- a model using an exponential law for the degrees distribution - which seems suited for a disease such as SARS in urban areas [3]\n",
    "- a method from [3] for building the network by stages: first we build highly connected households, then the connections between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the epidemiological parameters of the disease, we adapted parameters from [4] to be suited for our model.\n",
    "Also, other models for the impact of a social tracing app have been proposed such as in [4] and [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "### The model\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vertex of the graph is an individual that can be : Healthy, Asymptomatic, Presymptomatic, Symptomatic, Dead or Recovered.\n",
    "At each step we go trough all the edges and with the probability given by these edges, there is a contact between the individuals.\n",
    "There is a parameterized proportion of close contact which are likely to propagate the virus and of being detected by the app, whereas further contact are less likely to propagate the virus but are not detected by the app. The last type of contact models evironnemental contamination by surfaces for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model implements several policies based on screening when an individual gets symptoms:\n",
    "- Warning after symptoms:\n",
    "    * If this policy is applied, the app sends notifications to the persons the infected individual met in the past 14 days as soon as the symptoms are detected. To be more realistic, in this case, non infected individuals may also send notifications at random to model other diseases with similar symptoms.\n",
    "    * If not, the individual passes a screening test and notifications are only sent if the test is positive (the result is only available after a predefined number of days, which is approximately 5 days for now in France).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quarantine after notification:\n",
    "    * If this policy is applied, a proportion of individuals receiving a notification goes in quarantine directly. They pass a screening test and stop the quarantine if it turns out to be negative.\n",
    "    * If not, individuals receiving a notification wait until they get the result of their test before going in quarantine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limits of the model\n",
    "\n",
    " * Some parameters like the proportion of asymptomatic persons and their infectiosity is not well known. While our work is based on their latest evaluation, they may be reevaluated quite differently in a few days or weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    " * We don't take into account the eventual false positives of nasal tests. We consider here that there are none.\n",
    "\n",
    " * The variability of infectiousness seems to be really high: an infected person that will develop symptoms is really contagious during the 2 days before the symptoms appear and is less contagious the 4 days after the symptoms appear, according to [6]. This could moderate our conclusions about the validity window in the \"results\" part as it gives us 2 to 3 free day during the incubation period.\n",
    "\n",
    " * The geographical heterogeneity of a nationnal territory is not taken into account, this is a simulation just for one isolated community\n",
    "\n",
    " * The community is also homogeneous : differences in sex, age or prior conditions that would affect the infection are not taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    " * In the initial state a proportion of the population (5%) is contaminated at the same time. In reality, after the end of the lockdown, the infected will have been contaminated at different instant, smoothing the pressure on healthcare systems.\n",
    " \n",
    " * The distribution of the time an individual spends as asymptomatic or symptomatic follows a geometrical law. In reality it seems that they are more close to a normal or lognormal distribution. However, beacause symptomatics are quarantined and asymptomatic are not the most infectious, this biais should not impact to much the dynamic of the epidemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * Contaminations from presymptomatic individuals are critical and social distancing can be effective to limit their effect. However, individuals must be warned early (since they do not yet display symptoms). The duration of the signaling chain must be less than the 5 days incubation period.\n",
    " * Even with quicker and more precise screening, the app seems unlikely to be effective because of the validity window of nasal tests.\n",
    " * The advice of quarantining upon recieving a notification, especially for recent contact, can be a response to this issue but at a high social and economic cost.\n",
    " * The \"warning after symptoms\" policy can be useful to get around the testing delays of symptomatic people if those are longer than 2/3 days. For this, though, we need to precisely identify COVID-19 symptoms and distinguish them from similar symptoms of other diseases.\n",
    " * The proportion of users of the app in the population is a central parameter. Under 20% of users, the effects of the app are insignificant, even in a best case scenario. In reality, depending on the policies adopted this threshold could be much higher.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Baseline case: no contact tracing\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master/images/0%25%2C-%2C-%2C[3%2C10]%2C5j%2C0.3.png\" alt=\"no contact tracing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The epidemic spreads freely from the 5% initial infected rate until almost all the population gets infected.\n",
    "The initial Rt (R0) (red curve) is a bit lower than 2 because in the initial population, 10% of the individuals are cured and because people who suffer of symptoms directly quarantine themselves.\n",
    "This was not the case at the beginning of the outbreak when R0 was evaluated around 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take this graph as reference for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Influence of the waiting time for tests results\n",
    "\n",
    "We use these test parameters to model the current test abilities in France:\n",
    " * 5 days to wait for test results\n",
    " * a 3 to 10 days validity window\n",
    " * 30% of false positives\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a great adoption of the app the population (80%), no change in the way the epidemic spreads is visible because of the test delay.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master/images/80%25%2C-%2C-%2C[3%2C10]%2C5j%2C0.3.png\" alt=\"current testing params in France, 80% adoption\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the critical time period to keep in mind to curb the spread of the disease is the 5 days incubation period.  \n",
    "According to the last epidemiological statistics, it seems that asymptomatic people make up to about 40% of the infected people - yet they are the cause of only 6% of infections. [4]\n",
    "On the contrary, the infectiousness of presymptomatic people appears to be really high [4] [6] - so much so that most contaminations originate from them.\n",
    "Moreover, when symptoms arise the affected person goes into quarantine. This means that symptomatic transmission is contained if this measure is well respected.  \n",
    "Thus, presymptomatic contaminations are the most significant, and efforts should focus on them.\n",
    "To avoid them, it is necessary to identify and quarantine infected people at the beginning of the incubation period. Therefore, a 5-day delay is already too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: The spikes every 5 days in test demand are due to the fact that an individual cannot ask for a new test if he is already waiting for results.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the current testing abilities in France, the characteristic time is of `2*5=10` days between the suspicions of the first infected person and the quarantining of the person notified and infected by the latter. The quarantine arrives far too late to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the validity window of nasal tests is a key factor that limits their effectiveness. Even if we succeed in having almost perfect tests (1% of false positives) and results available with no delay, we will not be able to identify and isolate presymptomatic people that just got infected because of the 3-10 days validity window.  \n",
    "Here is a comparison with and without the validity window:\n",
    "\n",
    "* with the validity window:\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master/images/80%25%2C-%2C-%2C[3%2C10]%2C0j%2C0.01.png\" alt=\"with validity window\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "* without the validity window:\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master/images/80%25%2C-%2C-%2C[-1%2C100]%2C0j%2C0.01.png\" alt=\"without validity window\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the validity window, we can only identify infected people 3 days after the infection, which is already a significant part of the incubation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "* with more realistic testing parameters (2 days of delay and 15% of false negative) (still better than current tests) :\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master/images/80%25%2C-%2C-%2C[3%2C10]%2C2j%2C0.15.png\" alt=\"with better tests\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with better screening, we can see that the curve of the test requests appears earlier, but the\n",
    "quarantine curve doesn't change much. This can be explained by the fact that a close contact has a probability of only about 2% of causing a contamination (according to a WHO report in China [8]). This leads to a high test demand from persons that only have a low chance of being infected. Moreover, in the best case, the decision to quarantine is taken 4 days after the infection, also too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these simulations the demand for tests is unrealistically high because we don't add any constraints on test capacity.\n",
    "We may imagine a more nuanced system to determine if we need a test: the number of notifications received, the presumed infectiousness of the infected person at the time of the contact, the comorbidity factors, etc. This could allow a more precise evaluation of the risk an individual has of getting infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 'Quarantine after notification' policy\n",
    "\n",
    "* application of the \"quarantine after notification\" policy and with current tests\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master/images/80%25%2CN%2C-%2C[3%2C10]%2C5j%2C0.3.png\" alt=\"quarantine after notification with current tests\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a more aggressive response against the epidemic and is proven to be effective even with the current test abilities. However, a great part of its effectiveness is likely to be due to the massive quarantine it causes (80% of the population).  \n",
    "Notice the oscillations of the number of people in quarantine: when the pandemic first spreads, a great part of the population quarantines itself because of the many notifications received. After testing, a lot of them get negative results and end their quarantine, causing the epidemic to spread again.\n",
    "\n",
    "* application of \"quarantine after notification\" and with better tests (2 days of delay and 15% of false negative):\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master/images/80%25%2CN%2C-%2C[3%2C10]%2C2j%2C0.15.png\" alt=\"quarantine after notification with better tests\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of this policy is greater with quicker tests because presymptomatic people get notified earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is illustrated by the rapid collapse of Rt during the first days (red curve). \n",
    "In this case, this policy uses quick testing to get earlier and more efficient quarantines.\n",
    "With such tests parameters, the average number of quarantine days per person is also reduced as the waiting time for test results is shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be expected that such a policy comes with a high social cost because of its strict quarantining.\n",
    "Indeed, because of the great number of close contacts in a day (13 on average), almost all the users of the app would quarantine themselves after the first wave of contaminations.  \n",
    "This high social cost could hamper the adoption of the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "A response to this problem can be to send a notification only to earlier contact. Instead of warning all the close contact that happended in the last 14 days when testing positive as we did in all our other simulations, we can warn only the contacts of the 7 last days. \n",
    "* application of \"quarantine after notification\" and with better tests (2 days of delay and 15% of false negative) and notificaiton of contacts in the last 7 days:\n",
    " <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuilhemN/covid-19-tracing-app-modelling/master/images/80%2CN%2C-%2C%5B3%2C10%5D%2C2j%2C0.15_avec_daysNotif_a_7.png\" alt=\"quarantine after notification with better tests\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we still warn presymptomatics in the begining of their incubation period without useless qurantine of older contacts that, even if they led to an infection, are now symptomatic or asymptomatic.\n",
    "This lower the timer spent by healthy person in quarantine of 2 days without speeding to much the spread of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, if test results can be available quickly, both the effectiveness of this policy and the social cost are improved.\n",

    "\n",
    "The proportion of notifications sent because of symptoms unrelated to COVID-19 is difficult to estimate. However if we manage to keep it fairly low ( < 0.5% chance of having COVID-looking symptoms per person per day) this policy can be an effective workaround for test delays and test reliability if applied with the \"quarantine after notification\" policy.
